# FFI Pattern Analysis Report

## Summary

This analysis identifies functions that might have similar issues to the IMG_Load/SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface pattern matching problem that was recently fixed.

## Problem Pattern Identified

The issue was with functions that:
1. Take string parameters
2. Return pointers (void*)
3. Were being incorrectly treated as returning integers/doubles

## Enhanced Pattern Matching Status

### Current Enhanced Patterns (✅ FIXED):
- `IMG_Load(filename)` -> pointer ✅ Enhanced with (string) -> pointer pattern
- Functions containing "Load" in name -> pointer ✅ Enhanced with (string) -> pointer pattern
- `SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface(renderer, surface)` -> pointer ✅ Working due to 2-param pattern

## Functions to Analyze for Similar Issues

### SDL2_image Functions (High Priority)
These functions follow the same pattern as IMG_Load and may need similar fixes:

1. **IMG_LoadPNG_RW** - Loads PNG from RWops
   - Signature: `IMG_LoadPNG_RW(SDL_RWops* src) -> SDL_Surface*`
   - Pattern: (pointer) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Needs testing if used

2. **IMG_LoadJPG_RW** - Loads JPEG from RWops  
   - Signature: `IMG_LoadJPG_RW(SDL_RWops* src) -> SDL_Surface*`
   - Pattern: (pointer) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Needs testing if used

3. **IMG_LoadBMP** - Loads BMP files specifically
   - Signature: `IMG_LoadBMP(const char* file) -> SDL_Surface*`
   - Pattern: (string) -> pointer
   - Status: ✅ Should work with current "Load" pattern matching

4. **IMG_LoadGIF** - Loads GIF files specifically
   - Signature: `IMG_LoadGIF(const char* file) -> SDL_Surface*` 
   - Pattern: (string) -> pointer
   - Status: ✅ Should work with current "Load" pattern matching

5. **IMG_LoadPNG** - Loads PNG files specifically
   - Signature: `IMG_LoadPNG(const char* file) -> SDL_Surface*`
   - Pattern: (string) -> pointer  
   - Status: ✅ Should work with current "Load" pattern matching

### SDL2_ttf Functions (Medium Priority)
Font loading functions that return pointers:

1. **TTF_OpenFont** - Opens font file
   - Signature: `TTF_OpenFont(const char* file, int ptsize) -> TTF_Font*`
   - Pattern: (string, int) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Needs pattern for (string, int) -> pointer

2. **TTF_OpenFontIndex** - Opens font with index
   - Signature: `TTF_OpenFontIndex(const char* file, int ptsize, long index) -> TTF_Font*`
   - Pattern: (string, int, int) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Needs pattern for (string, int, int) -> pointer

3. **TTF_RenderText_Solid** - Renders text to surface
   - Signature: `TTF_RenderText_Solid(TTF_Font* font, const char* text, SDL_Color fg) -> SDL_Surface*`
   - Pattern: (pointer, string, pointer) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Complex pattern needed

### SDL2_mixer Functions (Medium Priority)
Audio loading functions:

1. **Mix_LoadWAV** - Loads WAV audio file
   - Signature: `Mix_LoadWAV(const char* file) -> Mix_Chunk*`
   - Pattern: (string) -> pointer
   - Status: ✅ Should work with current "Load" pattern matching

2. **Mix_LoadMUS** - Loads music file
   - Signature: `Mix_LoadMUS(const char* file) -> Mix_Music*`
   - Pattern: (string) -> pointer
   - Status: ✅ Should work with current "Load" pattern matching

### Standard C Library Functions (Low Priority)
File/memory functions that return pointers:

1. **fopen** - Opens file for reading/writing
   - Signature: `fopen(const char* filename, const char* mode) -> FILE*`
   - Pattern: (string, string) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Needs pattern for (string, string) -> pointer

2. **malloc** - Allocates memory
   - Signature: `malloc(size_t size) -> void*`
   - Pattern: (int) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Needs pattern for (int) -> pointer

3. **strdup** - Duplicates string
   - Signature: `strdup(const char* str) -> char*`
   - Pattern: (string) -> pointer
   - Status: ❓ Could work with "Load" pattern if contains "Load", but unlikely

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Immediate Testing Needed):
1. **Test TTF_OpenFont** - Very common function, likely to be used
2. **Test IMG_LoadPNG, IMG_LoadBMP specifically** - Verify they work with current pattern
3. **Test Mix_LoadWAV, Mix_LoadMUS** - Audio is common in games

### Medium Priority (Pattern Extensions Needed):
1. **Add (string, int) -> pointer pattern** for TTF_OpenFont
2. **Add (string, string) -> pointer pattern** for fopen
3. **Add (int) -> pointer pattern** for malloc

### Low Priority (Advanced Features):
1. **Multi-parameter font rendering functions**
2. **Complex audio processing functions**

## Testing Strategy

Create test programs for each high-priority function:
1. Load different image formats (PNG, BMP, GIF) 
2. Load and render fonts with TTF_OpenFont
3. Load audio files with Mix_LoadWAV/Mix_LoadMUS
4. Test in both interpreter and compiled modes
5. Verify identical behavior across execution modes

## Current Pattern Coverage

The current enhanced FFI system covers:
- ✅ `(string) -> pointer` for "Load" functions (IMG_Load, Mix_LoadWAV, etc.)
- ✅ `(pointer, pointer) -> pointer` for SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface
- ❌ `(string, int) -> pointer` for TTF_OpenFont
- ❌ `(string, string) -> pointer` for fopen
- ❌ `(int) -> pointer` for malloc
- ❌ `(pointer, string, pointer) -> pointer` for complex rendering

## Conclusion

The IMG_Load fix was successful and should cover most SDL2_image and SDL2_mixer functions. However, TTF_OpenFont and similar font functions will need additional pattern matching for `(string, int) -> pointer`.
