# Documentation Update: Removed Production-Ready References

## Summary

Updated all documentation files to remove "production-ready" references and replaced them with more appropriate alpha/development phase language.

## Files Updated

### README.md

- Updated SDL2 section header from "Production Ready" → removed qualifier
- Replaced "production-ready Foreign Function Interface" → "comprehensive Foreign Function Interface"
- Updated texture loading comments to remove "production-ready"
- Changed "Production Ready" bullet point → "Complete FFI System"

### MANUAL.md
- Changed main status from "production-ready" → "in active development" with "alpha phase"
- Updated FFI description from "Production-ready" → "Alpha-phase"
- Replaced FFI features "Production-Ready Graphics" → "Enhanced Graphics"
- Updated compilation comment from "production" → "deployment"
- Changed SDL2 section header removal
- Updated texture support comments
- Changed deployment references from "production" → "deployment"

### .github/copilot-instructions.md
- Updated FFI description from "Production-ready" → "Comprehensive"

- Updated deployment references
- Simplified architecture description

### Enhanced_FFI_Implementation_Summary.md
- Changed "Production Ready Status" → "Alpha Development Status"
- Updated conclusion from "production-ready" → "feature-complete"

### Test Files
- Updated enhanced_ffi_test.bas to remove "production use" → "testing"

## Language Changes Made

### Removed Terms:
- "production-ready"
- "Production Ready"
- "production deployment"
- "production use"

### Replacement Terms:
- "alpha phase" / "alpha development"
- "in active development"
- "feature-complete"
- "comprehensive"
- "enhanced"
- "deployment" (instead of "production deployment")
- "testing" (instead of "production use")

## Rationale

The project is currently in alpha development phase with:
- Core features implemented and working
- Comprehensive testing ongoing
- API and functionality still evolving
- Community feedback being incorporated

Removing "production-ready" language accurately reflects the current development status while maintaining confidence in the implemented features and capabilities.

## Testing Verification

- All test programs continue to work correctly
- No functional changes made to code
- Only documentation and comment updates
- Cross-mode compatibility maintained

The project remains fully functional with all current features working as expected, but now accurately represents its alpha development status.
